## Package Structure

Packages are simply ZIP archives. Take this simple example...

```
plankton-0.4.0.zip
├── manifest.yml
├── Plankton.gha
├── Plankton.dll
└── misc/
    ├── README.md
    └── LICENSE.txt
```

## Important Things to Note

1. Packages **must** have a top-level [`manifest.yml`](manifest.md) file
2. Any plug-ins (`.rhp` or `.gha` files) **must** be in the top-level directory
   so that Rhino and Grasshopper can find and load them
3. If you're packaging a `.gha` plug-in, you **should** ensure that the package
   name and version number in the `GH_AssemblyInfo` sub-class match those in the
   `manifest.yml` file, otherwise [package restore][1] won't work\*

\*OK, it will probably still work _a bit_.
